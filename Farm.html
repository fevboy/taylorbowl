</div>

<div
class="content">
    Blooms have a base chance of 1 in 4500 of occurring every second, so one Bloom occurs on average every 4500 seconds or 90 minutes. This interval of 4500 seconds is known as the Growth Denominator and can be reduced by Farmers using the command <span class="command-text">!water</span>. The Growth Denominator can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>. When a Bloom occurs, an embed will be sent in certain Discord channels with the title 'The Bloom!' and how much planted credits grew.
    <br> <br>
    The Growth Rate is determined by many factors, but the most significant is the Blight Strength. In short, the longer it has been since the last Blight, the higher the Growth Rate. Less significant determinants are the Growth Denominator and Blight Power, or the percentage of credits that a Blight will destroy. As either decrease, the Growth Rate decreases slightly. The Growth Rate can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>. The increase in credits from Blooms is rounded to the nearest whole number. The number of credits a farmer will receive from a Bloom can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farmer</span>.
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="General_Mechanics#Blights">
    Blights
</div>

<div
class="content">
    The Blight has a Strength and Maximum Strength. The Blight Strength starts at 0 and increases by 1 every second until it reaches its Maximum Strength. The chance for a Blight to happen starts at 1 divided by the Maximum Strength and slowly increases every second. For example, if the Maximum Strength is 100 000, the chance of a Blight happening in the first second is 1 in 100 000. In the second second, it is 1 in 99 999; in the third second, it is 1 in 99 998 and so on. By the time the Blight Strength reaches the Maximum Strength, a Blight is guaranteed to happen. The Blight Strength and Maximum Strength can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>. When a Blight occurs, an embed is sent in certain Discord channels with the title 'The Blight', as well as other relevant information such as the Blight Strength at which it occurred, the number of credits destroyed, and more.
    <br> <br>
    The Blight Power refers to the percentage of credits destroyed by a Blight, ranging from 0 to 1 (or equivalently 0% to 100%). It is 1 by default, so all credits will be destroyed, but can be reduced by strengthening. The percentage of strengthened credits can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>, which when subtracted from 1 gives the Blight Power.

Farmers remove their planted credits from the Farm using the command <span class="command-text">!harvest</span>, which removes all their planted credits. This makes them no longer Farmers, so the effect of any watering or strengthening performed is removed. After planting, watering, or strengthening, a farmer must wait for at least 1 Bloom to occur before being able to harvest. A farmer may only harvest 1 time during a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bot_Cycle" data-tippy-content="A Bot Cycle is a period between two Bot Restarts.">Bot Cycle</a>.

    Water & Strengthen
</div>

<div
class="content">
Water and strengthen are both considered persistent Actions. This means that using them once applies their effects for the rest of the Bot Cycle. Farmers who have used a persistent action during the current Bot Cycle are considered Active Farmers. After a Bot Restart, all Active Farmers become Passive Farmers, reducing the effect of their action. Passive Farmers count as 0.3x of Active Farmers. Using the Action again will make them Active Farmers again. Becoming an Active Farmer multiplies the Blight Strength by 1.0075. However, if becoming an Active Farmer would make the Blight Strength exceed the Maximum Strength, it will fail. This happens at around 99.26% of the Maximum Strength.
<br> <br>
Users may use the command <span class="command-text">!water</span> to multiply the current Growth Denominator by 0.985, or the command <span class="command-text">!strengthen</span> to reduce the Blight Power. See the Calculations section for more details. Each Farmer can only use one of these Actions at once, but can switch between them at any time. Doing so will not multiply the Blight Strength as they were already an Active Farmer.

Weed is a one-time action. Each Farmer can only use it once every Blight Cycle. Users may use the command <span class="command-text">!weed</span> to reduce the Blight Strength. The amount reduced depends on what percentage of the Farmer's credits are in the Farm, increasing with a greater percentage to a maximum of 2%.

    Blight Takeover
</div>

<div
class="content">
Most Blights do not happen instantly, instead happening in 2 phases. However, if the Farm is unsafe, or if the Blight was not natural<sup>1</sup>, they will happen instantly. The usual 2 phases of Blights that happen when the Farm is safe are Immunity and Takeover, gradually destroying credits over time.
<br> <br>
At the start of Immunity, a Warning Bloom, also known as Lily's Bloom, occurs. It functions the same as a regular Bloom, but instead of saying 'The Bloom!', it says 'The World's Gone Beautiful.', which is a reference to <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lily-s-proposal">one of the many SCP-001s</a>. During Immunity, no credits are destroyed. The duration of Immunity depends on the number of Bloom Periods since the previous natural<sup>1</sup> Bloom. One Bloom Period is equivalent to the Growth Denominator in seconds, i.e. a Growth Denominator of 4000 means the Bloom Period is 4000 seconds. For every half Bloom Period since the previous natural<sup>1</sup> Bloom, the duration of Immunity increases by 1 second, rounded up. This means Immunity is always at least 1 second long. Immunity does not increase constantly, i.e. 0.1 Bloom Periods and 0.4 Bloom Periods since the last natural<sup>1</sup> Bloom will still result in a 1 second Immunity, but 0.49 and 0.5 Bloom Periods since the last natural<sup>1</sup> Bloom will result in 1 and 2 second Immunities respectively. Harvesting during Immunity will harvest all of the credits the Farmer has. Immunity is followed by Takeover.
<br> <br>
At the start of Takeover, 25% of credits that can be destroyed are destroyed instantly. Another 50% of such credits are gradually destroyed every second during Takeover, which lasts a random duration between 7 and 22 seconds. The more strengthened credits there are, or equivalently the lower the Blight Power, the shorter the duration of Takeover. Harvesting during Takeover will harvest the remaining credits the Farmer has, and will indicate how many credits they were able to salvage from their original amount. At the end of Takeover, the final 25% of credits are destroyed, and the embed with information about the Blight is sent.
<br> <br>
<sup>1</sup> Natural Blooms and Blights refer to Blooms and Blights that occur without using Invocations.       
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Advanced_Mechanics#Safety">
    Safety
</div>

<div
class="content">
The Blight Strength has a Threshold, which splits the Farm into two periods, 'safe' and 'unsafe'. When the Blight Strength is below the Threshold, the Farm is safe, and above, it is unsafe. 
The Threshold Percentage, which is the Current Strength as a percentage of the Threshold, can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>. When the Threshold Percentage is above 100%, the Farm is unsafe. The Threshold starts at 99% of the Maximum Strength, and is multiplied by 0.99 every time a Farmer uses the command <span class="command-text">!weed</span> successfully. If the Farmer who weeded is no longer in the Farm, the Threshold does not return to its previous value. It will only reset after a Blight happens.
<br> <br>
During the safe period, Lily's Bloom will always occur before a natural<sup>1</sup> Blight, and it will go through its stages of Immunity and Takeover. During the unsafe period, Lily's Bloom will not occur, and Blights will happen instantly instead of gradually destroying credits. However, during the unsafe period, the Growth Rate also increases dramatically, reaching a maximum of 1000%.

    Growth Rate
</div>

<div
class="content">
The Growth Rate is based on Blight Strength, Maximum Strength, Safety, Growth Denominator, and Blight Power. The Growth Rate can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>. In full detail, the formulae for the Growth Rate are:
<div
class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\mathrm{Growth\,rate}=\begin{cases}
    (1.9^{\cfrac{2D}{2D+M-S}}-1)\cdot\sqrt{P}+\cfrac{\left(\cfrac{S}{M}\right)^{5}}{50} & \mathrm{when\,Farm\,is\,safe} \\ (2.4^{\cfrac{2D}{M-S}}-1)\cdot\sqrt{P}+\cfrac{\left(\cfrac{S}{M}\right)^{5}}{50} & \mathrm{when\,Farm\,is\,unsafe}\end{cases}$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(D\) is the Growth Denominator, \(M\) is the Maximum Strength, \(S\) is the Blight Strength, and \(P\) is the Blight Power.
<br> <br>
In other, more understandable words, the Growth Rate increases faster as the Blight Strength increases, and increases much faster when the Farm is unsafe. The Growth Rate is slightly reduced when there are Active Farmers, but becoming an Active Farmer will always increase the average returns because it multiplies the Blight Strength and evens out the decrease. However, there are some instances where becoming an Active Farmer will reduce the Growth Rate slightly. This only happens when the Blight Strength is relatively low, but the average returns are still higher.
<br> <br>
The numbers 1.9 and 2.4 in the safe and unsafe formulae respectively are known as the "Base". When the Farm undergoes balancing, these values are typically the first to be changed. An increase results in an overall higher Growth Rate and a decrease results in the reverse.

    The Maximum Strength is not a fixed value. Each Blight, it can increase or decrease by up to 5% of its current value. It originally started at 500 000. Given an extremely long period of time, it is expected to decrease slightly (see the Calculations section for more details), and this effect is unofficially called "climate change". Over many months of Blights, the Maximum Strength decreased to below 200 000, prompting a manual reset back to 500 000 on 19 November 2024 and the introduction of ways to counter climate change, namely Ward and Terraform.
    <br> <br>
    After a Blight, the new Maximum Strength will be shown in the Blight message, and the current can be checked any time using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>.

Water & Strengthen
</div>

<div
class="content">
Since Passive Farmers are counted as 0.3 of an Active Farmer for water and strengthen, the equivalent number of Active Farmers is given by the formula:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$n=n_{a}+0.3n_{p}$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(n\) is the equivalent number of Active Farmers, \(n_{a}\) is the number of Active Farmers, and \(n_{p}\) is the number of Passive Farmers.
<br> <br>
The Growth Denominator is given by the formula:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$D=4500\cdot 0.985^{n}$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(D\) is the Growth Denominator.
<br> <br>
This means that each subsequent water has 98.5% the effect of the previous water, leading to diminishing returns.
<br> <br>
The Blight Power is given by the formula:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$P=0.96^{\sqrt{n}}$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(P\) is the Blight Power.
<br> <br>
Similarly to watering, this means that each subsequent strengthen has less effect that the previous strengthen, also leading to diminishing returns. However, it is difficult to quantify how much less of an effect it is.
<br> <br>
The calculation to determine the point at which becoming an Active Farmer is not possible due to increasing the Blight Strength past the maximum is as such:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$\text{Current Strength}\cdot 1.0075 = 1 \\ \text{Current Strength} = \cfrac{1}{1.0075} \\ \text{Current Strength} \approx 0.9926 = 99.26%$$</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Farm#Calculations#Threshold">
Threshold
</div>

<div
class="content">
For some Farmers, it is helpful to know how many new Active Farmers can join the Farm before the Current Strength exceeds the Threshold and makes the Farm unsafe. The derivation and formula are as such:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$P_{T}\cdot 1.0075^{\Delta n} < 1 \\ 
1.0075^{\Delta n} < \cfrac{1}{P_{T}} \\ 
\ln(1.0075^{\Delta n}) < \ln \cfrac{1}{P_{T}} \\ 
\Delta n \ln 1.0075 < -\ln P_{T} \\ 
\Delta n < -\cfrac{\ln P_{T}}{\ln 1.0075}
$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(\Delta n\) is the number of new Active Farmers that can join the Farm and \(P_{T}\) is the Current Threshold Percentage.
<br> <br>
It is also possible to calculate the number of weeds performed during the current Blight Cycle as such: 
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$P_{B} = \cfrac{\text{Current Strength}}{\text{Maximum Strength}} \\
P_{T} = \cfrac{\text{Current Strength}}{\text{Threshold}} = \cfrac{\text{Current Strength}}{\text{Maximum Strength}\cdot 0.99^{w+1}} \\
\therefore P_{T} = \cfrac{P_{B}}{0.99^{w+1}} \\ 
0.99^{w+1}=\cfrac{P_{B}}{P_{T}} \\ 
\ln(0.99^{w+1})=\ln\cfrac{P_{B}}{P_{T}} \\ 
(w+1)\ln0.99=\ln P_{B} - \ln P_{T} \\
w=\cfrac{\ln P_{B} - \ln P_{T}}{\ln0.99}-1$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(w\) is the number of weeds, \(P_{B}\) is the Current Blight Percentage, and \(P_{T}\) is the Current Threshold Percentage.
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Farm#Calculations#Maximum_Strength">
Maximum Strength
</div>

<div
class="content">
The occurrence of climate change can be explain through the following. Since the Maximum Strength can increase or decrease by between 0 and 5%, the average increase across all instances where the Maximum Strength increases is 2.5% and likewise for the average decrease. Since the change is applied to the current Maximum Strength, it is multiplicative across multiple Blights, and thus the average change per Blight is given by:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$\cfrac{1.025\cdot0.975-1}{2}=-0.0003125=-0.03125%$$</span></p>
</div>
This indicates that the average change in Maximum Strength across multiple Blights is negative, and thus over time, the Maximum Strength will tend downwards. However, because the change is imposed on the current Maximum Strength, as the Maximum Strength decreases, the magnitude of the decrease is also reduced.
<br> <br>
Previously, it was believed that using Ward and/or Terraform consistently would allow the Maximum Strength to hover at a specific calculable value. However, after running simulations, it instead tended to fluctuate wildly, but never tended in any particular direction. This is likely due to the random nature of the changes in Maximum Strength.
