    Blooms
</div>

<div
class="content">
    Blooms have a base chance of 1 in 4500 of occurring every second. When a Bloom occurs, all planted credits grow by a certain percentage, known as the Growth Rate.
    <br> <br>
    The chance for a Bloom to occur can be increased. On average, one bloom occurs every 4500 seconds, or 90 minutes. Farmers can water the farm to decrease this average time between Blooms, known internally as the Growth Denominator. The Growth Denominator can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>.
    <br> <br>
    The Growth Rate is determined by a number of factors. Most significant is the current Blight Strength. As the Blight Strength increases linearly, the Growth Rate increases exponentially. If the Farm is considered “unsafe”, the Growth Rate receives a significant increase. Less significant determinants are the Growth Denominator and Blight Power. As either decrease, the Growth Rate decreases slightly. The Growth Rate can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>.
    <br> <br>
    Almost always the number of credits after a Bloom is not an integer. The actual amount returned is always rounded down to the nearest integer. The number of credits a farmer will receive from a Bloom can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farmer</span>.
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="General_Mechanics#The_Blight">
    The Blight
</div>

<div
class="content">
    The Blight is the event that resets the Farm. Each period between two Blights is colloquially known as a Blight Cycle or Farm Cycle.
    <br> <br>
    The Blight has a Strength and Maximum Strength. The Blight Strength starts at 0 and increases by 1 every second until it reaches its Maximum Strength, which typically is above 200 000. The chance for a Blight to happen in any given second is the Blight Strength divided by the Maximum Strength. Thus, it is guaranteed to occur by the time the Blight Strength reaches the Maximum Strength. The Blight Strength and Maximum Strength can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>.
    <br> <br>
    As the Blight Strength increases, the Growth Rate increases exponentially. The Farm is most profitable at high Blight Strengths. However, there is a higher chance per second for the Blight to occur at higher Strengths.
    <br> <br>
    The Blight Power refers to the percentage of credits destroyed by the Blight, ranging from 0 to 1. By default, it is 1, but can be reduced by strengthening. The percentage of strengthened credits can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>, which when subtracted from 1 gives the Blight Power.

    A farmer can perform 5 different actions - plant, harvest, water, strengthen, and weed. Water and strengthen are mutually exclusive; a farmer may only do one or the other at any given time. The command <span class="command-text">!farmer</span> can be used to check a farmer's current action (water, strengthen), action status (Active, Passive, none), ability to harvest and ability to weed.

<div

    Planting using the command <span class="command-text">!plant amount</span> places that number of credits into the Farm. Those credits continue to belong to the farmer who planted them, and are known as planted credits. 
    <br> <br>
    A farmer must plant a minimum number of credits, determined by a few factors. Firstly, the amount planted must be at least 1 credit. Secondly, the amount planted must be able grow by at least 1 credit when a Bloom occurs. Thirdly, the amount planted must be at least 2.5% of the user's total credits. These are given by the formulae (with results rounded up):
    <div
    class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\mathrm{Minimum}=\mathrm{min}\begin{cases}(\mathrm{Total\,credits}\cdot0.025) & \\ 1\div\mathrm{Growth\,rate} & \\ 1 & \end{cases}$$</span></p>

Harvest
</div>

<div

    Farmers may harvest using the command <span class="command-text">!harvest</span> to remove all their credits from the Farm. They are no longer considered farmers after doing so, thus the effect of any watering or strengthening performed is removed. The effects of weeding remain.
    <br> <br>
    After planting, watering, or strengthening, a farmer must wait for at least 1 Bloom to occur before being able to harvest. A farmer may only harvest 1 time during a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bot_Cycle" data-tippy-content="A Bot Cycle is a period between two Bot Restarts.">Bot Cycle</a>.

    Water
</div>

<div
class="content">
    Water is considered a persistent action. Once performed, it has a lasting effect on the Farm and performing it multiplies the Blight Strength by 1.0075. After a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bot_Cycle" data-tippy-content="A Bot Restart resets certain actions, or fixes BowlBot when broken.">Bot Restart</a>, any farmers who used the command <span class="command-text">!water</span> change from Active farmers to Passive farmers. The effect of their action is equivalent to 0.3x of an Active farmer. Performing a persistent action while being a Passive farmer also multiplies the Blight Strength by 1.0075.
    <br> <br>
    You may use the command <span class="command-text">!water</span> to multiply the Growth Denominator by 0.985. This effect stacks multiplicatively, thus the formula for the Growth Denominator taking into account watering is:
    <div
    class="formula">
        <p><span>$$\mathrm{Growth\,denominator}=4500\cdot0.985^{n}$$</span></p>

<div

    You may use the command <span class="command-text">!strengthen</span> to multiply the Blight Power by a certain amount. This effect stacks, with the formula for the Blight Power taking into account strengthening is:
    <div
    class="formula">
        <p><span>$$\mathrm{Blight\,power}=0.96^{\sqrt{n}}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    and the percentage of strengthened credits is given by:
    <div
    class="formula">
        <p><span>$$\mathrm{Percentage\,of\,strengthened\,credits}=1-\mathrm{Blight\,power}$$</span></p>

    Weed is a one-time action. It can only be performed once per farmer per Blight Cycle, and its effects last until the end of the Blight Cycle, regardless of if the farmer still has credits in the Farm.
    <br> <br>
    You may use the command <span class="command-text">!weed</span> to reduce the Blight Strength. The amount reduced is proportional to the ratio of planted credits to total credits of the farmer, and reaches a maximum of 0.02 of the Blight Strength. It is given by the formula:
    <div
    class="formula">
        <p><span>$$\mathrm{Weed\,effectiveness}=0.02\cdot P\cdot\mathrm{Blight\,strength}$$</span></p>

    Watering and strengthening both decrease the Growth Rate to compensate for the increased profitability of the Farm. However, it is always true that watering and strengthening will still be beneficial for the expected returns.
    <br> <br>
    Strengthening decreases the Takeover period of the Blight Takeover (see <span class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Farm#Advanced_Mechanics#Blight_Takeover">Blight Takeover</span> for more information). 
    <br> <br>
    Neither watering nor strengthening is possible if performing the action would cause the Blight Strength to exceed the Maximum Strength, i.e. when the Blight Strength is 1/1.0075 of the Maximum Strength, or about 99.26% of Maximum Strength.

<div

    The Warning Bloom, known internally by a secret name, and known colloquially as Lily's Bloom, is a visually distinct Bloom that occurs before the Blight. While a regular Bloom reads “The Bloom!”, Lily's Bloom reads “The World's Gone Beautiful.” This is in reference to one of the many SCP-001s, known as "Lily's Proposal". Immediately following Lily's Bloom, the Blight Takeover begins.

<div
    class="content">
    The first stage is Immunity where no credits are destroyed. The duration of Immunity is determined by the number of Bloom Periods since the previous normal* Bloom. 1 Bloom Period is equivalent to the Growth Denominator in seconds. Immunity starts as 0 seconds and increases in integer steps by 1 second every half Bloom Period, always rounded up. This means it is at least 1 second long.
    <br>
    *see <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Farm#Invocations_&_Evocations">Invocations & Evocations</a>
    <br> <br>
    At the end of Immunity, the Blight destroys 25% of credits in the farm.
    <br> <br>
    Then, the Takeover Period begins. It lasts a random number of seconds between 7 and 22, destroying 50% of the original credits, or two-thirds of the remaining creds, over time. The number of credits destroyed in each second is equal. As the Blight's Power decreases, or equivalently, the percentage of strengthened credits increases, the Takeover period becomes shorter.
    <br> <br>
    At the end of the Takeover Period, the remaining credits, which are 25% of the original amount, are destroyed.
    <br> <br>
    To harvest without losses after Lily's Bloom, the farmer must harvest within Immunity, which is extremely challenging if the previous Bloom was recent.

    The Farm has a Threshold, which splits the “safe” Farm from “unsafe”. The Threshold starts at 99% of the Blight Maximum, and is multiplied by 0.99 each time a weed is performed. Below the Threshold, the Farm is safe, and above it is not.
    <br> <br>
    During the safe period, Lily's Bloom will always occur before a normal* Blight.

    The Growth Rate is based on Blight Strength, Maximum Strength, Safety, Growth Denominator, and Blight Power. The Growth Rate can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>. In full detail, the formulae for the Growth Rate are:
    <div
    class="formula">
        <p><span>$$\mathrm{Growth\,rate}=\begin{cases}
        (1.625^{\cfrac{2D}{2D+M-S}}-1)\cdot\sqrt{P}+\cfrac{\left(\cfrac{S}{M}\right)^{5}}{50} & \mathrm{when\,Farm\,is\,safe} \\ (2^{\cfrac{2D}{M-S}}-1)\cdot\sqrt{P}+\cfrac{\left(\cfrac{S}{M}\right)^{5}}{50} & \mathrm{when\,Farm\,is\,unsafe}\end{cases}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    where \(D\) is the Growth Denominator, \(M\) is the Maximum Strength, \(S\) is the Blight Strength, and \(P\) is the Blight Power. The "safe" condition is:
    <div
    class="formula">
        <p><span>$$\mathrm{Threshold\,percentage}<100\%$$</span></p>
    </div>
    The Threshold Percentage can be checked using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>.

<div

    Maximum Strength
</div>

<div
class="content">
    The Maximum Strength is not a fixed value. Each Blight, it can increase or decrease by up to 5% of its current value. It originally started at 500 000. Given an extremely long period of time, it is expected to decrease because an increase in 5% (multiply by 1.05) and a decrease in 5% (multiply by 0.95) is a resultant 0.25% decrease. This effect was unofficially known as "climate change". Over many months of Blights, the Maximum Strength decreased to below 200 000, prompting a manual reset back to 500 000 on 19 November 2024 and the introduction of ways to counter climate change.
    <br> <br>
    After a Blight, the new Maximum Strength will be shown in the Blight message, or it can be checked any time using the command <span class="command-text">!farm</span>.

    The original intention for Farm was for the user to assess the risks, plant credits, and leave them before returning to harvest. This would make the Farm much more probabilistic.
    <br> <br>
    However, after the introduction of Lily's Bloom, many farmers have taken to farming less often, but constantly monitoring the Farm while farming, ready to harvest should Lily's Bloom occur. Typically, these farmers farm when the strength is high to maximise their efforts.
