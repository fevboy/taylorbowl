    To cast a vote, typing a message with just the letter A or B counts as a vote to whichever track the letter is assigned to. Alternatively, typing a message with [A] or [B] included anywhere within it also counts as a vote. This is known internally as the Emi Example. If a message contains both [A] and [B], it is counted as a vote for A.
    <br> <br>
    At any time during a bowl, you may use the command <span class="command-text">/didivote</span> to check if you have voted. The command is only visible to you. It will show which option you voted for. If used when there is no bowl, it will show if you voted in the prior bowl.
    <br> <br>
    For most of the bowl, you may switch votes by revoting. However, you may not remove a vote. In the last minute of a bowl, switching votes is disabled. If <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls#Mechanics#Extra_Time" data-tippy-content="Extra Time is a period in Bowls when the original duration ends in a tie.">Extra Time</a> is enabled, you may switch votes again, but not in the last minute of Extra Time.

When you vote, you gain 10 <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Credits" data-tippy-content="Credits form the basis of the TaylorBowl economy. They are the most accessible and commonly used currency.">credits</a> for each bowl you vote in. This is increased by your Streak - the number of credits you receive increases by 10 when your Streak reaches a multiple of 7, i.e. it increases every 7 Bowls.
<br> <br>
If you are a Server Booster, Kintsugi, or both, you receive extra credits from voting. Server Boosters receive 1.25x of the standard, rounded up. Kintsugi receive 2x. Both of these can stack, leading to a 2.5x multiplier.
<br> <br>
You may use the command <span class="command-text">!streak</span> to display your current streak, as well as how many credits you will earn from voting in the next bowl.     You may use the command <span class="command-text">!rankstreak</span> to list up to the top 13 highest Streaks currently, and the command <span class="command-text">!rankstreakrecord</span> to list up to the top 13 highest Streak Records.
<br> <br>
Your highest streak of the Season, known as your Streak Record, contributes to your User Score. Up to 150 Streak Record, it acts as a multiplier. Above that, additional Streak Record is worth 20 User Score.

    Your credits earned from a Bowl are given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\text{Credits earned}=10m\cdot\Bigl\lfloor\cfrac{n}{7}\Bigr\rfloor$$</span></p>
    </div>
    where \(n\) is your Streak after voting in the given Bowl, and the multiplier \(m\) is given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$m=\begin{cases}1 & \text{for no bonuses} \\ 1.25 & \text{for Server Boosters} \\ 2 & \text{for Kintsugi} \\ 2.5 & \text{for Server Booster and Kintsugi} \end{cases}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    The total number of credits earned from a Streak is given by the formula:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$S_n=7\sum_{i=1}^{\Bigl\lfloor\cfrac{n}{7}\Bigr\rfloor}\lceil 10i\cdot m \rceil + 10\Bigl\lceil\cfrac{n}{7}\Bigr\rceil\left(n-7\Bigl\lfloor\cfrac{n}{7}\Bigr\rfloor\right)$$</span></p>
    </div>
    where \(S_{n}\) is the total number of credits, \(n\) is the final Streak reached, and \(m\) is the multiplier.
    <br> <br>
    Thus, the total number of credits earned starting from a Streak of length \(a\) and ending at one of length \(b\) is given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\text{Total credits earned}=S_{b}-S_{a}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    You may use the command <span class="command-text">/streakcurrent</span> to see how many credits you would earn at a given Streak, even if you are not at that Streak. You may use the command <span class="command-text">/streaknext</span> to determine the next Streak number where your credits earned increases. You may use the command <span class="command-text">/streakcumulative</span> to see how many credits you would earn in total from voting in a certain number of bowls, as well as how long it might take for you to reach that Streak. Note that <span class="command-text">/streakcumulative</span> is currently slightly inaccurate by about 0.25 credits per Bowl. However this is usually negligible.

<div
class="subsection-title"

    Autovote
</div>

<div
class="content">
    Autovote allows you to vote in Bowls you are not physically present for based on your <span class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Personal_Rankings" data-tippy-content="Personal Rankings are rankings of tracks unique to each user based on their history of votes and Personal Bowls.">Personal Rankings</span>. Doing so consumes credits each vote based on how many consecutive Bowls you have used Autovote. You may use the command <span class="command-text">!autovote</span> to start or stop Autovoting.
    <br> <br>
    When on Autovote, your streak becomes negative. This is just notation that describes your Autovote Streak, or how many consecutive Bowls you have Autovoted in. This value is used to determine the cost of each Autovote. It follows the same formula as for a regular streak, but the multiplier is given by \(m=-4\). If your credits go below 0, you will automatically stop Autovoting.
    <br> <br>
    Autovotes are cast at the start of each Bowl and your Autovote Status is saved at the end of each Bowl. The last vote cast determines your Autovote Status. Autovotes are also not noticeable in Bowls as they are internally processed. However, the command <span class="command-text">!sbowl</span> includes Autovotes.
    <br> <br>
    If you cast a vote normally then Autovote, your vote is considered an Autovote and you will be Autovoting at the end of the Bowl. If you do not cast a vote then Autovote, you will not have voted but you will be Autovoting at the end of the Bowl. If you Autovote then cast a regular vote, your vote is considered a regular vote and you will not be Autovoting at the end of the Bowl.
    <br> <br>
    To ensure you are Autovoting, you must be Autovoting at the end of the Bowl. Otherwise, a Bot Restart will remove you from Autovote. 
    <br> <br>
    To reset your Autovote Streak to 0, you must either vote normally in a Bowl or not vote in a Bowl. Simply using <span class="command-text">!autovote</span> twice will not reset it as it is only updated at the end of every Bowl.
    <br> <br>
    You may use the command <span class="command-text">!streak</span> to see how many credits it will cost to Autovote in the next bowl. You may use the command <span class="command-text">/autovotecost</span> to estimate the cost of Autovoting for a certain number of bowls. You may use the command <span class="command-text">/autovotehours</span> to estimate how long you can Autovote for given limited credits.

Fortify is an Invocation used to protect a user from having their vote be influenced. The command <span class="command-text">!fortify user</span> consumes 1 Ephemera to prevents the target from being Falsified or Expelled for 30 minutes.
<br> <br>
If Fortify is used on an already-Fortified user, it resets the timer to 30 minutes. It will not extend the user's Fortification by 30 minutes.
<br> <br>
Fortify will not cause an attempted Falsify or Expel to misfire. They will instead fail. 
<br> <br>
To maximise the effects of Fortify, it is recommended to Fortify near the end of a Bowl and confirm you have voted for your preferred track. This may allow Fortify to last an additional Bowl given the right circumstances.

Fortify will misfire if used on an inactive user.
