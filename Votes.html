Each user is entitled to one vote per bowl. Every vote awards the user credits. By voting in consecutive TaylorBowls, users can gain a Streak which awards them extra credits from voting. There is also Autovote where users instead spend credits to automatically vote in TaylorBowls. The cost of using Autovote increases with a user's Autovote Streak, which similarly increases by using Autovote in consecutive TaylorBowls. Two special types of votes exist but they are mainly used for <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/User_Score" data-tippy-content="User Score is a measure of a user's overall activity in TaylorBowl.">User Score</a>; First Votes are the first vote cast by any user and Hammer Votes can be understood as tiebreaking votes.

    To cast a vote, typing a message with just the letter A or B counts as a vote to whichever track the letter is assigned to. Alternatively, typing a message with [A] or [B] included anywhere within it also counts as a vote. This is known internally as the Emi Example. If a message contains both [A] and [B], it is counted as a vote for A.
    <br> <br>
    At any time during a bowl, you may use the command <span class="command-text">/didivote</span> to check if you have voted. The command is only visible to you. It will show which option you voted for. If used when there is no bowl, it will show if you voted in the prior bowl.
    <br> <br>
    For most of the bowl, you may switch votes by revoting. However, you may not remove a vote. In the last minute of a bowl, switching votes is disabled. If <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls#Mechanics#Extra_Time" data-tippy-content="Extra Time is a period in Bowls when the original duration ends in a tie.">Extra Time</a> is enabled, you may switch votes again, but not in the last minute of Extra Time.

Your Streak refers to the number of Bowls you have voted in consecutively. Your Streak resets to 0 if you miss a Bowl. Your highest Streak of the season is known as your Streak Record. Autovotes do not count towards your Streak, instead giving you a negative Streak.
<br> <br>
When you vote, you gain 13 <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Credits" data-tippy-content="Credits form the basis of the TaylorBowl economy. They are the most accessible and commonly used currency.">credits</a> for each bowl you vote in. This is increased by your Streak - the number of credits you receive increases by 13 when your Streak reaches a multiple of 6, i.e. it increases every 6 Bowls. If you are a Server Booster, Kintsugi, or both, you receive extra credits from voting. Server Boosters receive 1.25x of the standard, rounded up. Kintsugi receive 2x. Both of these can stack multiplicatively, leading to a 2.5x multiplier.
<br> <br>
Your highest streak of the Season, known as your Streak Record, contributes to your User Score. Your first 200 Streak Record is worth 1% of your Base Score each, up to 200% Base Score. Above that, additional Streak Record is worth 0.01% Base Score.
<br> <br>
You may use the command <span class="command-text">!streak</span> to display your current streak, as well as how many credits you will earn from voting in the next bowl. You may use the command <span class="command-text">!rankstreak</span> to list up to the top 13 highest ongoing Streaks, and the command <span class="command-text">!rankstreakrecord</span> to list up to the top 13 highest Streak Records of the Season.
<br> <br>
You may use the EsteBot command <span class="command-text">/streakcurrent</span> to see how many credits you would earn at a given Streak. You may use the EsteBot command <span class="command-text">/streaknext</span> to determine the next Streak number where your credits earned increases. You may use the EsteBot command <span class="command-text">/streakcumulative</span> to see how many credits you would earn in total from voting in a certain number of bowls, as well as how long it might take for you to reach that Streak depending on the average duration of each Bowl.

    There are three special votes that may occur in Bowls. These have no special impact on the Bowl, but contribute to other things.
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Special_Votes#Autovote">
    Autovote
</div>

<div
class="content">
    Autovote allows you to vote in Bowls you are not physically present for based on your <span class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Personal_Rankings" data-tippy-content="Personal Rankings are rankings of tracks unique to each user based on their history of votes and Personal Bowls.">Personal Rankings</span>. Doing so consumes credits each vote based on how many consecutive Bowls you have used Autovote, also known as your Autovote Streak. You may use the command <span class="command-text">!autovote</span> to start or stop Autovoting.
    <br> <br>
    When on Autovote, any ongoing Streak is removed and a negative value is used instead. This is just describes your Autovote Streak, or how many consecutive Bowls you have Autovoted in, e.g. a Streak of -5 means you have voted in 5 consecutive Bowls using Autovote. This value is used to determine the cost of each Autovote. Similar to a regular Streak, the cost of each Autovote increases every 6 Bowls, but the base cost of each Autovote is 52, and increases by 52 every 6 Bowls. If you run out of Credits while Autovoting, your Autovote will stop.
    <br> <br>
    Autovotes cannot be seen being cast in Bowls as they are internally processed. However, the vote count in the command <span class="command-text">!sbowl</span> includes Autovotes.
    <br> <br>
    Autovotes are cast at the start of each Bowl and your Autovote Status is saved at the end of each Bowl. The last vote cast determines your Autovote Status. These details are important for the following scenarios:
    <br>
    If you use <span class="command-text">!autovote</span> during a Bowl that you have not yet voted in, you will not have voted for that Bowl, and will instead start Autovoting during the next Bowl.
    <br>
    If you cast a regular vote then use <span class="command-text">!autovote</span>, your vote is considered an Autovote and you will continue to Autovote during the next Bowl.
    <br> 
    If you use <span class="command-text">!autovote</span> then cast a regular vote, your vote is considered a regular vote and you will not be Autovoting in the next Bowl.
    <br> <br>
    To reset your Autovote Streak to 0, you must either vote normally in a Bowl or not vote in a Bowl. Simply using <span class="command-text">!autovote</span> twice in the same Bowl will not reset it.
    <br> <br>
    When you have an Autovote Streak, you may use the command <span class="command-text">!streak</span> to see how many credits it will cost to Autovote in the next bowl. You may use the EsteBot command <span class="command-text">/autovotecost</span> to estimate the cost of Autovoting for a certain number of bowls. You may use the EsteBot command <span class="command-text">/autovotehours</span> to estimate how long you can Autovote for given limited credits.

    The earliest vote in any server for either option, barring Autovotes, is considered the First Vote. The final vote in a bowl across all servers, if it is for the winning song, and said winning song won by a margin of 1 vote, is considered the Hammer Vote. Hammer Votes can be thought of as 'tiebreaking votes'. Each First and Hammer Vote is worth 1 User Score.

<div

Fortify is used to protect a user from having their <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Votes" data-tippy-content="Votes are what decide the winner and loser of a TaylorBowl.">vote</a> be influenced. The command <span class="command-text">!fortify user</span> consumes 1 <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ephemera" data-tippy-content="Ephemera are an uncommon currency used to perform Invocations.">Ephemera</a> to prevents the target from being Falsified or Expelled for 30 minutes, or until the next Bot Restart, whichever occurs sooner. If Fortify is used on an already-Fortified user, it resets the timer to 30 minutes. It will not extend the user's Fortification by 30 minutes. Fortify will not cause attempted Falsifys or Expels to misfire, instead causing them to fail and consume no Ephemera.
<br> <br>
To maximise the effects of Fortify, it is recommended to Fortify near the end of a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls" data-tippy-content="TaylorBowls are the primary minigame featured in the TaylorBowl Discord server.">Bowl</a> and confirm you have voted for your preferred track using the command <span class="command-text">/didivote</span>. This may allow Fortify to last an additional Bowl given the right circumstances.
<br> <br>
Fortify will misfire if the target is an inactive user. Fortify will misfire if used on a puppet.

Puppeteer is used to make a Puppet vote in a Bowl. Puppets refer to two specific Bots known as 'mother' and 'father'. The command <span class="command-text">!puppeteer choice user</span> consumes 1 Ephemera to make one of the Puppets vote for the specified choice. The names 'mother' and 'father' are used in the user parameter. Example: <span class="command-text">!puppeteer b mother</span>

Reinforce
</div>

<div
class="content">
Reinforce is used to protect the invoker from having their vote be influenced. The command <span class="command-text">!reinforce</span> consumes 3 Ephemera to prevent the user from being Falsified or Expelled if they have Ephemera on hand. If a user is Reinforced, they also have an additional 20% chance to have 1 Ephemera <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ephemera#Mechanics#Disintegration" data-tippy-content="Ephemera Disintegration is the random chance for Ephemera to disappear at the end of a TaylorBowl."></a> at the end of each Bowl.

Kickstart is used to increase a user's <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Votes#Streak" data-tippy-content="Streaks record the number of consecutive Bowls a user has voted in.">Streak</a>. The command <span class="command-text">!kickstart user</span> consumes 3 Ephemera to increase the target's current Streak by 8% of the target or invoker's Streak Record, whichever is lower. The increase is always rounded down. The effect of Kickstart is limited to a maximum of 20.
<br> <br>
A user's Kickstart increases in value every 12.5 Bowls, rounded up, e.g. 13, 25, 38, 50... and will reach its maximum at 250 Bowls.
<br> <br>
Kickstart will misfire if used when either the target or invoker has a Streak Record of 12 or less. Kickstart will misfire if its success would increase the target's current Streak past 92% of their Streak Record.

If the user targeted was using <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Votes#Special_Votes#Autovote" data-tippy-content="Autovote allows you to vote in bowls you are not present for.">Autovote</a>, Expel removes them from Autovote.
<br> <br>
Expel will misfire if there are no users to be Expelled. Expel will have reduced effectiveness if there is only 1 user to be Expelled as it will only remove their vote but still consume 5 Ephemera. Expel will misfire if a user's Current Streak is 92% or more of their Record Streak.

Streaks
</div>

<div
class="content">
    Autovote Streaks are defined as:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\text{Autovote Streak} = -\text{Negative Streak Value}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    The change in credits from voting regularly in a Bowl or voting with Autovote are given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\text{Credits earned}=13m_{1}m_{2}\cdot\Bigl\lfloor\cfrac{n}{6}\Bigr\rfloor$$</span></p>
    </div>
    where \(n\) is your Streak after voting in the given Bowl, \(m_{1}\) is the multiplier given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$m_{1}=\begin{cases}1 & \text{for no bonuses} \\ 1.25 & \text{for Server Boosters} \\ 2 & \text{for Kintsugi} \\ 2.5 & \text{for Server Booster and Kintsugi} \\ -4 & \text{for Autovote} \end{cases}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    and \(m_{2}\) is the Enhance multiplier given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\begin{cases}1 & \text{when not Enhanced or for Autovote} \\ 0.125n_{e} & \text{when Enhanced} \end{cases}$$</span></p>
    </div>
    where \(n_{e}\) is the number of Ephemera the user has.
    <br> <br>
    The total change in credits from a Streak or Autovote Streak is given by the formula:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$S_n=6\sum_{i=1}^{\Bigl\lfloor\cfrac{n}{6}\Bigr\rfloor}\lceil 13i\cdot m_{1}m_{2} \rceil + 13\Bigl\lceil\cfrac{n}{6}\Bigr\rceil\left(n-6\Bigl\lfloor\cfrac{n}{6}\Bigr\rfloor\right)$$</span></p>
    </div>
    where \(S_{n}\) is the total number of credits, \(n\) is the final Streak reached, \(m_{1}\) is the multiplier, and \(m_{2}\) is the Enhance multiplier.
    <br> <br>
    Thus, the total change in credits starting from a Streak or Autovote Streak of length \(a\) and ending at one of length \(b\) is given by:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>$$\text{Total credits earned}=S_{b}-S_{a}$$</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Calculations#Kickstart">
Kickstart
</div>

<div
class="content">
The value of user A's Kickstart on themself \(K_{A}\) is given by:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$K_{A}=\text{max}\left(\lfloor0.08\cdot S_{A}\rfloor, 20\right)$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(S_{A}\) is user A's Streak Record.
<br> <br>
The value of user A's Kickstart on user B is then given by:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$\text{Kickstart Value}=\text{max}\left(K_{A}, K_{B}\right)$$</span></p>
</div>
The increase in the total credits earned from using 1 Kickstart can be given by the formula for the total change in credits starting from a Streak or Autovote Streak of length \(a\) and ending at one of length \(b\). However, it can instead be estimated by the formula:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$c=\cfrac{1}{6}kbs$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(c\) is the increase in total credits, \(k\) is the Kickstart Value, \(b\) is the base number of credits earned from voting, given by \(13m\) where \(m\) is the multiplier, and \(s\) is the number of Bowls remaining in the Streak.
<br> <br>
Rearranging the formula, the number of Bowls a user must vote in to increase the total credits earned from 1 Kickstart by a certain amount is given by:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$s=\cfrac{6c}{kb}$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(s\) is the number of Bowls to be voted in, \(c\) is the number of credits to be earned, \(k\) is the Kickstart Value, and \(b\) is the base number of credits earned from voting, given by \(13m\) where \(m\) is the multiplier.
