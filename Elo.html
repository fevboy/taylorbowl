    History

<div
class="content">
When TaylorBowl first started, tracks were assigned an Elo based on a series of polls conducted in the subreddit <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/" data-tippy-content="r/TaylorSwift is the largest Taylor Swift subreddit on the social media platform Reddit.">r/TaylorSwift</a> from March to August 2016. Tracks ranked higher were assigned higher Elo. The average Elo of all songs was, and still is, 2000.
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Elo_System#Elo_Changes">
    Elo Changes
</div>

<div
class="content">
When a bowl ends, the amount of Elo gained by the winning song is the same as that lost by the losing song (i.e. if track A wins and gains 20 Elo, track B loses 20 Elo). This ensures the average remains the same. Elo change is determined by the number of votes, the Tier of the Bowl, and the difference in Elo between both tracks.
<br> <br>
The following statements assume the other two factors remain the same. For the number of votes, generally speaking, the larger the difference in votes between the two tracks, the larger the Elo change. For the Tier of the Bowl, Tiers closer to Tier 5 will have a greater Elo change than those further from Tier 5, e.g. Tier 6 will have a greater Elo change than Tier 0. For the difference in Elo between both tracks, if a track with higher Elo wins, the Elo change will be lesser. Conversely, if a track with lower Elo wins, the Elo change will be greater.

id="Elo_System#New_Tracks">
    New Tracks
</div>

<div
class="content">
When new tracks are added, there are two possible ways for their Elo to be determined. For tracks added en masse, such as the 31 songs on <span class="song-text">THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY</span>, they are all assigned an Elo of 0. As the lowest Elo of a normal song tends to be above 800, and the highest of newly added tracks tend to be below 400, the newly added songs do not interact with any existing ones. At the turn of the next <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Seasons" data-tippy-content="A Season is a four-month period in TaylorBowl. Between Seasons, resets of Elo and User Score occur.">Season</a>, their Elo are manually adjusted based on the final results from their time spent separate from the other tracks by simply adding 2000. Alternatively, new tracks may be placed directly at 2000 Elo. This often happens with smaller sets of new tracks, such as Vault Tracks or singles such as <span class="song-text">Carolina</span>. 
<br> <br>
Notably, when <span class="song-text">All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</span> was added in February 2022 at 2000 Elo, it won all of its bowls for 26 days with a Win Streak of 23, before being defeated by <span class="song-text">champagne problems</span>.

    Main article: <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Seasons">Seasons</a>
</div>

<div
class="content">
At the end of every Season, all tracks undergo a “soft reset” of their Elo. The #1 track is placed at 2900 Elo, or the minimum for Tier 0, and all other tracks adjust such that the proportion of distances between them remain the same. For example, a track at the midpoint between the #1 track and 2000 Elo before the reset will still be at the midpoint after the reset.
<br> <br>
This regular soft reset ensures that matchups remain possible. As tracks win and lose bowls, those with very high or very low Elo tend to be too far from other tracks for matchups due to the Sufficient Closeness Eligibility requirement. If left unchecked, eventually there may no longer be any valid matchups.

Elo Change
</div>

<div
class="content">
The formulae to calculate Elo changes as a result of a TaylorBowl are different based on the number of votes. For two tracks receiving A and B votes, it is given by the formulae:
<div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$\Delta \text{Elo}=K\cdot(S_{A}-E_{A})$$
    </span></p>
</div>
where the K Value, \(K\), is given by:
<div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$K=\begin{cases}
        3m\max(A,B) & \text{when}\,\max(A,B)<7 \\
        45m\log_{10}(|A-B|-4) & \mathrm{when}\,|A-B|>7 \\
        25m & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}$$
    </span></p>
</div>
and its multiplier, \(m\), is given by:
<div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$m=1-\cfrac{|T-5|^{2}}{83}$$
    </span></p>
</div>
where \(S_{A}\) is the score of a track, which is 1 if it wins and 0 if it loses; and \(E_{A}\) is the track's current expected score, given by:
<div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$E_{A}=\cfrac{1}{1+10^\cfrac{{R_{B}-R_{A}}}{400}}$$
    </span></p>
</div>
where \(R_{A}\) and \(R_{B}\) are the Elo ratings of track A and B respectively.
<br> <br>
The Elo change of tracks is directly proportional with both the K Value (\K\) and the difference in score and expected score of the tracks \(S_{A}-E_{A}\).
<br> <br>
Taking the multiplier \(m\) as a constant which effectively compares results of TaylorBowls within the same Tier: When the highest number of votes for either track is less than 7, the K Value scales linearly with said highest number of votes. When the difference in votes between both tracks is less than 7 and the highest number of votes for either track is greater or equal to 7, the K Value is a constant. When the difference in votes between both tracks is greater than 7 (and by trivial extension the highest number of votes for either track is greater than 7), the K Value scales logarithmically with the difference in votes between both tracks minus a constant. This prevents extreme cases where tracks may change Elo drastically.
<br> <br>
The K Value is directly proportional with the multiplier \(m\), which is inversely related with the distance from Tier 5 of the Tier, \(|T-5|\) where \(T\) is the Tier. Thus, the multiplier is at its largest when the Tier is 5, and reduces the further from Tier 5 the Tier is. This implies that TaylorBowls with similar results will result in smaller Elo changes if they occur further from Tier 5 and vice versa. This is likely implemented to prevent tracks in Tiers 0, 1, 9, and 10 from having too large of an Elo difference between each other to allow for TaylorBowls.
<br> <br>
The expected score of a track \(E_{A}\) is determined by the Elo of itself and the track it faces in a Bowl. The track with a higher Elo will have a higher expected score, and it is related with the difference in Elo. The expected scores of two tracks in a Bowl have a sum of 1. In TaylorBowl, due to the Sufficient Closeness Eligibility requiement, the largest and smallest possible expected scores are ! and ! respectively. If the tracks have the same Elo, both will have an expected score of 0.5.
