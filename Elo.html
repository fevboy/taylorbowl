            All <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Tracks">tracks</a> in TaylorBowl are assigned an Elo value, which is a way of giving each a score. The value increases when a song wins a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls">TaylorBowl</a> but decreases when it loses one. Based on these Elo, tracks are separated into Tiers.

            Elo was originally assigned by <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bianca">Bianca</a> based on external polls, but is now determined by bowls.

            To find the elo of a track, the commands <span class="command-text">!elo name</span> or <span class="command-text">!elo #ranking</span> can be used.

        <div
        class="History-content">
            When TaylorBowl first started, tracks were assigned an Elo based on a series of polls conducted in the subreddit <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/">r/TaylorSwift</a> from March to August 2016. Tracks ranked higher were assigned higher Elo. The average Elo of all songs was, and still is, 2000.

        </div>

        <div
        class="Elo-Changes-content">
            When a bowl ends, the amount of Elo gained by the winning song is the same as that lost by the losing song (i.e. if song A wins and gains 20 Elo, song B loses 20 Elo). This ensures the average remains the same. The Elo change is determined by the Tier of the bowl and the number of votes. For two songs receiving A and B votes, it is given by the formulae:
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>
                    $$\Delta \mathrm{Elo}=K\cdot(S_{A}-E_{A})$$
                </span></p>
            </div>
            where the K Value, \(K\), is given by:
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>
                    $$K=\begin{cases}
                    3m\max(A,B) & \mathrm{when}\,\max(A,B)<7 \\
                    45m\lg(|A-B|-4) & \mathrm{when}\,|A-B|>7 \\
                    25m & \mathrm{otherwise}
                    \end{cases}$$
                </span></p>
            and its multiplier, \(m\), is given by:
                <p><span>
                    $$m=1-\cfrac{|T-5|^{2}}{83}$$
                </span></p>
            </div>
            \(S_{A}\) is the score of a track, which is 1 if it wins and 0 if it loses; \(E_{A}\) is the track's current Elo.
        </div>

        class="subsection-header"
        id="Elo_System#New_Tracks">
            New Tracks
        </div>

        <div
        class="New-Tracks-content">

            When new tracks are added, there are two possible ways for their Elo to be determined.
            <br> <br>
            For tracks added en masse, such as the 31 songs on <span class="song-text">THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY</span>, they are all assigned an Elo of 0. As the lowest Elo of a normal song tends to be above 800, and the highest of newly added tracks tend to be below 400, the newly added songs do not interact with any existing ones. 
            <br> <br>
            At the turn of the next <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Seasons">Season</a>, their Elo are manually adjusted based on the final results from their time spent separate from the other tracks by simply adding 2000. The formula for their new Elo is given by:
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>
                    $$\mathrm{New\,Elo}=2000+\mathrm{Original\,Elo}$$
                </span></p>
            </div>
            Alternatively, new tracks may be placed directly at 2000 Elo. This often happens with smaller sets of new tracks, such as Vault Tracks or singles such as <span class="song-text">Carolina</span>.
            <br> <br>
            Notably, when <span class="song-text">All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</span> was added in February 2022 at 2000 Elo, it won all of its bowls for 26 days with a Win Streak of 23, before being defeated by <span class="song-text">champagne problems</span>.         

        </div>

        <div
        class="subsection-header"
        id="Elo_System#Season_Resets">
            Season Resets

        <div

            Main article: <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Seasons">Seasons</a>
        </div>

        <div
        class="Season-Resets-content">
        At the end of every Season, all tracks undergo a “soft reset” of their Elo. The #1 track is placed at 2900 Elo, or the minimum for Tier 0, and all other tracks adjust such that the proportion of distances between them remain the same. This is much like the process for adding new tracks to the main list.
        <br> <br>
        This is done so that matchups remain possible. As tracks win and lose bowls, those with very high or very low Elo tend to be too far from other tracks for matchups due to Criterion 1. Thus, by pushing tracks closer together regularly, matchups of these tracks are still possible. 
        <br> <br>
        The formula for their new Elo is given by:     
        <div class="formula">
            <p><span>
                $$\mathrm{New\,Elo}=2000+\cfrac{900\cdot(\mathrm{Original\,Elo}-2000)}{\mathrm{Highest\,Original\,Elo}-2000}$$
            </span></p>

        <div
        class="Tier-System-content">
            Tracks are split into 11 Tiers based on their Elo. The Tiers are numbered 0 to 10, where Tier 0 has the highest Elo tracks and Tier 10 has the lowest. As Tier 5 is in the middle, and tracks with 2000 Elo are placed there, it has the greatest number of tracks. The further from Tier 5, the less tracks there are in any given Tier.
            <br> <br>
            To view all tracks in a Tier, the command <span class="command-text">!tier number</span> can be used. It lists all songs in a given Tier from highest to lowest Elo.

        <div
        class="Divisions-content">
            All Tiers except 0 and 10 span 200 Elo, and these boundaries do not change even with Season Resets:
            <br> <br>
            Tier 0: 2900 Elo and above <br>
            Tier 1: 2700-2899 Elo <br>
            Tier 2: 2500-2699 Elo <br>
            Tier 3: 2300-2499 Elo <br>
            Tier 4: 2100-2299 Elo <br>
            Tier 5: 1900-2099 Elo <br>
            Tier 6: 1700-1899 Elo <br>

            Each Tier is also assigned a colour. These are purely aesthetic but <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bianca">Bianca</a> has detailed the reasons for each colour:
            <br> <br>
            Tier 0: Black, from anti-default when written in text <br>
            Tier 1: Purple, based on Overwatch Grandmaster Aura <br>
            Tier 2: Lavender, based on Overwatch Masters Aura <br>
            Tier 3: Periwinkle, from diamond <br>
            Tier 4: Gray, from platinum <br>
            Tier 5: Yellow, from gold <br>
            Tier 6: Dark Gray, from silver <br>
            Tier 7: Orange, from bronze <br>
            Tier 8: Maroon, as it is between bronze and wood aesthetically <br>
            Tier 9: Brown, from wood <br>
            Tier 10: White, from default when written in text

            Tiers impact how much a bowl affects the Elo of both songs, as covered in <span class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Elo_System#Elo_Changes">Elo System#Elo Changes</span>.
            <br> <br>
            When forcing or queueing bowls, the further the Tier of the bowl from Tier 6, the more expensive it is. For every Tier of distance from Tier 6, the cost doubles, i.e. a Tier 1 costs double of a Tier 2, which is double of a Tier 3, etc. and a Tier 4 costs the same as a Tier 8 as they are both 2 Tiers from Tier 6. The exception is a Tier 0 bowl, which costs 4 times of what it normally would. (Main article: <span class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Forcing_&_Queueing">Forcing & Queueing</span>) 
            <br> <br>
            The default length of all bowls (i.e. those from a natural start) is 11 minutes, except for Tier 0 bowls, which is 22 minutes.
