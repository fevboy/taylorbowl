They are started with the command <span class="command-text">!taylorbowl</span> and last, by default, 11 minutes. Every Bowl has two <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Tracks" data-tippy-content="Tracks are songs in TaylorBowl.">tracks</a> chosen from a list of matchups which have the letter 'A' or 'B' given to them. They receive <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Votes" data-tippy-content="Votes are what decide the winner and loser of a TaylorBowl.">votes</a> by users sending their letter alone in a message. At the end of the time, the Bowl will end and the track with more votes gains a score called <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Elo" data-tippy-content="Elo is a track's score which reflects how liked the track is.">Elo</a> while the other track loses Elo.

<div

    To start a TaylorBowl, the command <span class="command-text">!taylorbowl</span> is used. Using this command successfully is unofficially known as a "natural start". This starts a Bowl at a random <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Elo#Tier_System" data-tippy-content="Tiers are a way of classifying tracks based on their Elo.">Tier</a> and it will last 11 minutes. This can be changed through <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Forcing_&_Queueing" data-tippy-content="Forcing and queueing TaylorBowls starts a TaylorBowl with specifications such as Tier, duration, and track.">forcing or queueing</a> Bowls, which lets users choose a specific Tier, duration, or even matchup. If a bowl is queued, it will take priority and natural starts cannot happen.
    <br> <br>
    Between TaylorBowls, there is a 2 minute "cooldown" period where no new Bowls can be started, but other actions can be done. This was done for "post-discussion" after certain Bowls. The durations for a default TaylorBowl and cooldown were chosen as they add up to 13.

<div

    Every TaylorBowl has two song options, chosen from a list of <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Tracks#Matchups_&_Eligibility" data-tippy-content="Matchups are a pair of tracks that can be put in a Bowl.">matchups</a>. The song with the higher Elo is assigned the letter A, and the song with lower elo is assigned the letter B. Sending either letter as its own message counts as a vote. Alternatively, sending any message containing [A] or [B] counts as a vote for that option. If a message contains both [A] and [B], it is counted as a vote for A. You can switch votes by simply voting again except during the last minute of each Bowl.
    <br> <br>
    The command <span class="command-text">!showbowl</span> or its shortened form <span class="command-text">!sbowl</span> can be used at any point during the Bowl to show the two options and the number of votes each currently has. The command <span class="command-text">/didivote user</span> can be used at any point during the bowl to privately check if you or a specified user has voted, and for which song. If used after a Bowl ends, the command shows whether you voted in the previous Bowl. Note that there is an edge case where using <span class="command-text">/didivote</span> during the logging period of a Bowl will not show whether the user voted in the Bowl that just ended, but instead the one before it.

    If at the end of a Bowl there is an track with more votes than the other, it is chosen as the winner. <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bots#BowlBot" data-tippy-content="BowlBot is the main bot in TaylorBowl and all features stem from it.">BowlBot</a> will then enter a "logging" period, which typically lasts between 15 and 30 seconds. This is counted as part of the bowl cooldown. 
    <br> <br>
    At the end of each logging period, BowlBot saves all changes that happened during the Bowl. This is a sort of mini-backup. When Bot Restarts happen, anything that happened since the end of the previous Bowl is not saved. This includes data of the bowl that ended as well as other areas including but not limited to <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Farm#Blooms" data-tippy-content="Blooms are events where credits in the Farm grow.">Blooms</a> and <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/The Blight" data-tippy-content="Blights are events where credits in the Farm are destroyed.">Blights</a>, changes in currency, <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Votes#Special_Votes#Autovote" data-tippy-content="Autovote allows you to vote in bowls you are not present for.">Autovoting</a> status, and <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Credits#Usage#Transfers" data-tippy-content="Credits can be transferred from one user to another, subject to a tax.">transfers</a>.
    <br> <br>
    At the end of the logging period, BowlBot sends a summary message of the bowl. It includes the two songs and their resultant ranks, total votes acquired by both, and voters for each side from the server the message is sent in.
    <br> <br>
    If the number of votes is tied, Extra Time happens which lasts 2 minutes. This is known internally as the 'Lydia Rule'. Switching votes is re-enabled for the first minute and disabled for the last minute. Bribing is enabled but will not have any effect unless Tiebreaker happens.
    <br> <br>
    If at the end of Extra Time the number of votes is still tied, the Tiebreaker happens. Votes cannot be cast or changed and the only way to influence the outcome is through bribing. The command <span class="command-text">!tiebreak amount</span> or its shorter alternative <span class="command-text">!bribe amount</span> bribes the specified number of Credits for the track you voted for. This means users who did not vote in a Bowl cannot bribe. At the end of the Tiebreaker, the winner of the Bowl is decided based on the number of Credits used to bribe.
    <br> <br>
    The probability that a given song X wins against another song Y is given by the formula:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$P(X\,\mathrm{wins})=\cfrac{\mathrm{Credits\,bribed\,for}\,X}{\mathrm{Total\,credits\,bribed}}$$
    </span></p>
    </div>
    The ratio of the probability that X wins against the probability that Y wins is given by the formula:
    <div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$P(X\,\mathrm{wins}):P(Y\,\mathrm{wins})=\mathrm{Credits\,bribed\,for}\,X:\mathrm{Credits\,bribed\,for}\,Y$$
    </span></p>
    </div>
    If any one song has no credits used to bribe for it, it has a 0% probability of winning. If both songs have no credits used to bribe for them, they both have a 50% probability of winning.
    <br> <br>
    At the end of every TaylorBowl, BowlBot sends a summary message of the Bowl, which includes the number of votes for both options and the votes of each member in the server; the change in Elo of both tracks; and the TaylorBowl number and time to log.
