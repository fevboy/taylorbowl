            TaylorBowl is a game played on Discord in select servers. Its core concept is choosing two similarly liked Taylor Swift tracks, and having players vote for whichever they prefer. The songs receive a score based on the voting, and the game continues forever.

            A pair of <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">tracks</a> appear in a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">TaylorBowl</a>, usually called a bowl, which is an 11 minute long round of voting. One song is assigned the letter A and the other is assigned the letter B, and <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">voting</a> is done by sending the letter of the song you prefer. At the <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">end of the bowl</a>, the songs change <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">scores</a> - the winner increases score and the loser decreases score.
            <br> <br>
            Between bowls, there is a 2 minute cooldown intended to allow additional discussion of the bowl that has just concluded. However, discussion can still happen at any time.

            TaylorBowl also has an economy based on <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Credits</a>, which are earned mainly through voting in bowls. There are minigames that allow you to gain or lose credits, such as <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Farn</a>, <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Risk</a>, <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Anti-Risk</a>, <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Ballpit</a>, and <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Yahtzee</a>.
            <br> <br>
            There are other currencies like <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Ephemera</a> and <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Perpetua</a> used to do powerful actions. There are also <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Potentia</a>, which are purchased and can be converted to credits or Ephemera.
            <br> <br>
            There are also other minigames such as <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">LyricRace</a> and <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">Combat</a> which may interact with credits, but are not fundamentally based on them. LyricRace is a timed series of questions related to Taylor Swift songs and lyrics, and Combat is a collectible card trading game using Taylor Swift songs to level up and fight with.
            <br> <br>
            Players can gain <a class="text-actionable-link" href="">User Score</a> related to participation in different aspects of TaylorBowl, such as how many bowls you have voted in or how many bowls you have started.
