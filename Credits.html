            To earn credits, there are ways involving no risk and ways involving a risk. For those with risk, the expected value of using them is typically around 1, meaning that repeating them in a random manner for a long time will typically not result in any gains or losses.

            For every <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Voting">vote</a> in a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls">TaylorBowl</a>, the user receives 10 Credits. This number is increased by your <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Voting#Streak">Streak</a>, which refers to the number of consecutive bowls you have voted in, resetting to 0 when you do not vote in a bowl. Every 7 bowls increases the number of credits received by 10.

Server Boosters receive 1.25x of the standard, rounded up. Kintsugi receive 2x. Both of these can stack, leading to a 2.5x multiplier.
            <br> <br>
            You can see the number of credits you will receive from voting in a bowl by using the command <span class="command-text">!streak</span>. It will display all your streak-related information.
            <br> <br>
            You can also use the <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bots#Este">Este</a> commands <span class="command-text">/streakcurrent</span> to calculate the number of credits obtained from your next vote at a given streak; <span class="command-text">/streaknext</span> to see the next streak where your credits obtained from voting increase; and <span class="command-text">/streakcumulative</span> to determine the total credits earned when you streak from a certain number to another. 
            <br> <br>
            Note: <span class="command-text">/streakcumulative</span> is not fully accurate for users who are Server Boosters but not Kintsugi, on average underestimating the number by 7 credits every 28 bowls, though this is a negligible amount.

            There are 7 minigames that can give you credits, 6 of which involve a risk.
            <br> <br>
            Farm is a farm simulator minigame that allows you to plant credits. At random intervals, they can grow by a certain percentage. They also have a smaller chance to be destroyed. (Main article: <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Farm">Farm</a>)
            <br> <br>
            The Commons is a variation of the Farm minigame, where credits are collectively planted and redistributed each time they grow. If a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bot_Cycle">Bot Restart</a> occurs, all credits in the Commons are destroyed. (Main article: <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/The_Commons">The Commons</a>)
            <br> <br>
            Ballpit is a minigame involving probability. 100 balls of different colours are randomly arranged, and the user may place a bet about which balls will appear first in the sequence. Depending on the rarity of the ball, the user receives different amounts of credits if they win. If they lose, all credits bet disappear. (Main article: <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ballpit">Ballpit</a>)
            <br> <br>
            Risk is a die-based minigame. A 20-sided die is rolled. If the number rolled is between 2 and 20, the user receives that number of credits. If the number rolled is 1, the user loses 209 credits. The user can also multiply all returns and losses by specifying an integer multiplier.

            <br> <br>
            Anti-Risk is a die-based minigame. A 20-sided die is rolled. If the number rolled is between 1 and 19, the user loses that number of credits. If the number rolled is 20, the user receives 190 credits. The user can also multiply all returns and losses by specifying an integer multiplier.

            <br> <br>
            Yahtzee is a dice-based minigame. Five 6-sided dice are rolled, and each roll costs 10 credits. Depending on the combination of numbers shown, the user has a chance of earning credits. Every Bot Cycle, all users get a number of free Yahtzee rolls that do not cost credits. (Main article: <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a>)
            <br> <br>
            LyricRace is a race-style minigame. No credits are required to play. A set of 13 prompts related to Taylor Swift’s songs and albums are given, and the user is asked to answer correctly as fast as possible. Depending on how long the user took to answer all 13 questions, they will receive credits at the end of the race.

        <div
        class="Wealth-Tax-content">
            Wealth tax is applied to all users with 10 000 credits and above. It is applied every 50 <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls">TaylorBowls</a>, removing a certain percentage of users total credits, or their on-hand and planted credits added together. The percentage taxed increases linearly based on the number of credits you have, by 0.5% every 100 000 credits, and reaching a maximum of 50%. It is given by the formula:
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>
                    $$\mathrm{Tax\,percentage}=\mathrm{Number\,of\,credits}\cdot0.000\,005\%$$
                </span></p>
            </div>  
            Since the wealth tax is a percentage, the amount taxed increases quadratically based on your credits. That is, if your credits increase by n times, your wealth tax increases by n^2 times. For example, 100 000 credits incur a tax of 500, 200 000 credits incur a tax of 2000, and 400 000 credits incur a tax of 8000. The number of credits taxed is given by the formula:
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>
                    $$\mathrm{Tax}=\cfrac{(\mathrm{Number\,of\,credits})^{2}}{20\,000\,000}$$
                </span></p>
            </div>  
            You may use the command <span class="command-text">!owed</span> to see the number of credits you owe due to wealth tax, and the command <span class="command-text">!taxes</span> to see the total number of credits the server owes due to wealth tax, the last taxation, and the next taxation.

        <div
        class="Transfer-Tax-content">
            Transfer tax is applied when credits are transferred. It is given by the formula:
            <div class="formula">
                <p><span>
                    $$\mathrm{Tax}=\mathrm{max} \begin{cases}
                    8\cdot(\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{Credits\,transferred}))^{2} & \\
                    0.025\cdot(\mathrm{Credits\,transferred}) &
                    \end{cases}$$
                </span></p>
            </div>  
            Since, for smaller numbers of credits, the logarithmic function is greater than the linear one, transfer tax percentage is higher for smaller numbers of credits, decreasing as the amount increases. However, once transfers are at least 4201 credits, the percentage value stabilises at 2.5%.
            <br> <br>
            You may use the command <span class="command-text">!transfercost</span> to determine how many credits will be taxed for a transfer of a given size. You may use the <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bots#Este">Este</a> command <span class="command-text">/wantedtransfer</span> to determine how many credits must be transferred for a desired number of credits to be received.

            Inactivity decay is applied to “inactive” users. Users are classified as inactive if they have not voted in a bowl during the current season, or if they are not a member of a server with TaylorBowl. Like wealth tax, it is applied every 50 bowls. The tax is always 0.25% of a user's total credits or 1 credit, whichever is greater. It is given by the formula:

            The number of credits used to create <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ephemera">Ephemera</a> from credits by condensing is based on both the condensor's credits and active credits. The amount needed is the largest of: 0.075% of active credits, 1.5% of the condensor's total credits, or 1989 credits. It is given by the formula:
