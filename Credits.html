Credits form the basis of the TaylorBowl economy. They are the most accessible and commonly used currency and the majority of actions related to currency involve credits. You may use the command <span class="command-text">!creds</span> to check the number of credits you have. The easiest way to obtain credits is through <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Voting" data-tippy-content="Votes are what decide the winner and loser of a TaylorBowl.">voting</a> in <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls" data-tippy-content="TaylorBowls are the primary minigame featured in the TaylorBowl Discord server.">TaylorBowls</a>. Each vote awards 13 credits, and voting in consecutive Bowls will award more credits per vote. Many minigames can also award credits, but some are equally or more likely to cause losses.
<br> <br>
Credits are widely used, with some notable functions being transferring to other users, <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Forcing_&_Queueing">Forcing & Queueing</a> TaylorBowls, <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls#Mechanics#Tiebreaker">Bribing</a> in TaylorBowls, using <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Votes#Special_Votes#Autovote" data-tippy-content="Autovote allows you to vote in bowls you are not present for.">Autovote</a>, creating <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ephemera">Ephemera</a>, increasing your <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ephemera#Ephemera_Level" data-tippy-content="">Ephemera Level</a>, or used in <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/The_Dojo" data-tippy-content="">The Dojo</a>.
<br> <br>
Credits are taxed to encourage users to actively spend them. There are three taxes: Wealth Tax, Inactivity Decay, and Transfer Tax. Wealth Tax applies to users with over 10 000 credits and increases its percentage value with the number of credits. Inactivity Decay applies to inactive users, which refers to users either no longer in any TaylorBowl-enabled servers, or who have not voted in a TaylorBowl during the current season. Both the aforementioned taxes apply every 25 Bowls by default. Transfer Tax applies when credits are transferred between users, which taxes at most 2.5% of the transferred amount.

    Minigames
</div>

<div
class="content">
There are 7 minigames that can give you credits, 6 of which involve a risk.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Farm">Farm</a> is a farm simulator minigame that allows you to plant credits and wait for them to grow. Every second, there is a chance for a Bloom to occur, rewarding you with credits. There is also a much smaller chance for The Blight to occur, which destroys most or all your credits.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/The_Commons">The Commons</a> is a variation of the Farm minigame, where credits are collectively planted. When a Bloom occurs, all credits in The Commons are equally distributed among all users who planted at least 1 credit. If a <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Bot_Cycle" data-tippy-content="A Bot Restart resets certain actions, or fixes BowlBot when broken.">Bot Restart</a> occurs, all credits in the Commons are lost.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Ballpit">Ballpit</a> is a minigame involving probability. 100 balls of different colours are randomly arranged, and users place bets on which balls will appear first in the sequence. If the bet is correct, the user is awarded credits. The higher they bet, and the rarer the combination of balls, the more credits are awarded. If the bet is wrong, the credits they bet are lost.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Risk_&_Anti-Risk">Risk</a> is a die-based minigame where a 20-sided die is rolled. If the number rolled is between 2 and 20, the user receives that number of credits. If the number rolled is 1, the user loses 209 credits. The user can also multiply all returns and losses by specifying a multiplier.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Risk_&_Anti-Risk">Anti-Risk</a> is another die-based minigame where a 20-sided die is rolled. If the number rolled is between 1 and 19, the user loses that number of credits. If the number rolled is 20, the user receives 190 credits. The user can also multiply all returns and losses by specifying a multiplier.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a dice-based minigame. Five 6-sided dice are rolled, and each roll costs 10 credits. Certain combinations of numbers on the dice will award credits. Otherwise, none are awarded. Every Bot Cycle, all users get some free Yahtzee rolls that do not cost credits.
<br> <br>
<a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/LyricRace">LyricRace</a> is a race-style minigame. No credits are required to play. A set of 13 prompts related to Taylor Swift's songs and albums are given, and the user is asked to answer correctly as fast as possible. Depending on how long the user took to answer all 13 questions, they will receive credits at the end of the race.
<br> <br>
These minigames make it possible for a user to obtain negative credits. For example, starting with 100 credits, a user could play Ballpit with all 100 of them. Since Ballpit only deducts credits after a Ballpit is completed, the user may lose 50 credits to Risk in the meantime. If their Ballpit bet was wrong, they lose 100 credits and end up with -50. While a user has negative credits, they are unable to do anything that requires credits, and any new credits will go towards removing their negative credits.

    Wealth Tax
</div>

<div
class="content">
Wealth Tax is applied to all users with 10 000 credits and above. By default, it is applied every 25 <a class="text-actionable-link" href="https://taylorbowl.wiki/TaylorBowls">TaylorBowls</a>, removing a certain percentage of users total credits, or their on-hand and planted credits added together. The percentage taxed increases linearly based on the number of credits you have, by 0.5% every 100 000 credits, and reaching a maximum of 50%. This means the amount taxed increases quadratically, that is, if your credits increases by \(n\) times, your Wealth Tax increases by \(n^{2}\) times.
<br> <br>

You may use the command <span class="command-text">!owed</span> to see the number of credits you owe due to wealth tax, and the command <span class="command-text">!taxes</span> to see the total number of credits the server owes due to wealth tax, the last taxation, and the next taxation.

    Transfer Tax
</div>

<div

Transfer Tax is applied when credits are transferred from one user to another. It is given by the formula:
<div class="formula">

    </span></p>
</div>
Simply put, as you transfer more credits, the Transfer Tax decreases until a minimum of 2.5%.

Wealth Tax
</div>

<div
class="content">
The formula for Wealth Tax is given by:
<div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$\text{Tax percentage}=0.000\,005\% \cdot n$$
    </span></p>
</div>  
where \(n\) is the number of credits.
<br> <br>
Since the wealth tax is a percentage, the amount taxed is directly proportional to \(n^{2}\). The number of credits taxed is given by the formula:
<div class="formula">
    <p><span>
        $$\text{Tax}=\cfrac{n^{2}}{20\,000\,000}$$
    </span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div
class="subsection-title"
id="Calculations#Transfer_Tax">
Transfer Tax
</div>

<div
class="content">
Since, for smaller numbers of credits, the logarithmic function is greater than the linear one, transfer tax percentage is higher for smaller numbers of credits, decreasing as the amount increases. To find the minimum number of credits to transfer where the percentage tax is minimised, the following equation can be formed:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$8\log_{10}\left(n\right)^{2}=0.025n$$</span></p>
</div>
where \(n\) is the number of credits.
<br> <br>
Since it has no elementary solution, solving graphically, we find:
<div class="formula">
<p><span>$$n\approx 4201$$</span></p>
</div>
Thus, transfers of 4201 credits or more have the minimum tax percentage of 2.5%. This implies that transfers of 4200 credits and below should be avoided to reduce Transfer Tax as much as possible. In practice however, the optimisations are often small, e.g. the difference in Transfer Tax at \(n=250\), where the difference is largest, is only 40 credits. Note: While the tax percentage is actually slightly above 2.5% at \(n=4201\), due to rounding, it is effectively equal to 2.5%.
